# Ok, but how into running this?

Get Python3, and provide neccessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

and you are good to go. To scrap data simply use `python scrap_LV_data.py`.

To run simplest webserver and view data, type `python -m http.server 8080` and visit `localhost:8080` from your browser.
